Cognitive-based CAPTCHA refers to CAPTCHA that is based on cognitive abilities.
Cognitive talents are brain-based abilities that result from a unique blend of neurobiological
and psychological techniques. Human cognition and behavior include knowledge, con
centration, memory, judgment and appraisal, reasoning and calculation, problem solving,

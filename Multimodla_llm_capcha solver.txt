:CAPTCHA mechanisms and their corresponding solvers have continuously evolved in response to each other’s
advancement[17,19].Traditionaltext-andimage-basedCAPTCHAs
are weakened by deep-learning methods employing convolutional
models and segmentation-based techniques [20, 21, 27]. More ad
vanced architectures, including generative adversarial network
based solvers and transformer-based recognizers, further improved
solvers robustness against noisy and diverse schemes [30, 32]. Be
sides visual recognition, reinforcement-learning approaches showed
that even behavior-based CAPTCHAs can be bypassed by agents
learning human-like interaction pattern [2, 28]. However, the 
emergence of reasoning-based CAPTCHAs introduces semantics,
interactive, and multi-modal designs, necessitating solvers with advanced
logical-reasoning capabilities alongside strong image-comprehension
skills 

recent developments:With the advent of MLLMs and vision
language models(VLMs),recent work has begun to treat CAPTCHA
The attacker employs several prompting regimes that mirror our
experimental settings. (i) direct prompts that forward the original
instruction 𝑞 (Exp1); (ii) optimized prompts, where the attacker
designs a task-specific template with clearer reasoning rules and
output format (Exp2); and (iii) few-shot prompts, where labeled
examples are prepended (Exp4). For each model–task-type pair, the
prompt template is fixed during evaluation

Exp1 (original prompts): Each instance is presented with the
human-facing instruction 𝑞orig from the dataset. For every model
and task type we perform a single invocation per sample and re
port Pass@1 and latency. This corresponds to directly feeding the
webpage instruction to an MLLM without any prompt engineering.

Exp2 (optimized prompts): For each task type we design a
task-specific prompt template𝑞opt that standardizes the instruction,
clarifies rules, and imposes a strict output format. All other settings
are identical to Exp1. Comparing Exp1 and Exp2 isolates the effect
of task-level prompt engineering.

Exp3 (finite-retry regime): We consider an “until-correct” strat
egy where the attacker can attempt up to 𝑘 challenges of the same
type, stopping upon the first success or when a retry cap is reached.
Instead of explicitly running all such sequences, we extrapolate
Success@k and the expected number of calls from Exp2’s single
shot accuracy using a Bernoulli model (Section 4.5), and empirically
validate this approximation on a subset of tasks.

Exp4 (few-shot guidance on hard tasks): For the hardest task
types identified in Exp2, we prepend two manually verified exam
ples as few-shot demonstrations. At inference time, the model first
sees these example image–instruction–answer pairs, followed by
the test instance with the same optimized instruction. All decoding
parameters and parsing rules remain identical to Exp2.
